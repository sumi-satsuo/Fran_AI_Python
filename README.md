# FranPy

Discord bot powered by olama3 - personal project for learning purposes of dif libs

### ðŸ“¦ Setting up

**1.** Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumi-satsuo/Fran.git
```

**2.** Install using a dif env (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install .
```
Restart VStudio cause we dont like red false alerts :D

**3.** Create a .dot.local with your own keys based on the provided model (.env)

**4.** Ollama must be running for this to work, start the ollama app or run `ollama serve`
U might need to change the port according to your server, edit that out on fran_brain yes yes

**5.** You also need to setup your whole Discord client, we know how fun that is, so good luck out there :D

**Run and have fun**
